            Gas is a fundamental element for any public blockchain network such as Ethereum. Understanding how it works
            is key to efficiently use and develop on Ethereum.

          <h3>Ethereum Gas explained</h3>
          <p>
            Gas is an important concept within the Web3 world. It is the virtual fuel required to execute transactions
            on the network. Similar to how a car needs gasoline to drive. Most public blockchains denominate these
            transaction fees in their native currency.
          </p>
          <p>There are a few crucial aspects of using gas or transaction fees in public, permissionless networks:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Every transaction published on a blockchain imposes a cost of downloading, executing and verify it. People
              who run a node (validators) spend time, money and effort to do this for which they are compensated.
              Transaction fees are rewarded to them for providing these services.
            </li>
            <li>
              A fee market allows prioritization of transactions by &apos;tipping&apos; the validators for processing
              specific transactions more quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For smart contract platforms, it avoids computational waste in code, by setting a limit to how many steps
              of code executions it can perform within a transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, it prevents accidental or hostile infinite loops, e.g. denial of service (&apos;DDoS&apos;)
              attacks. In a DDoS attack, an attacker tries to flood the network by spamming empty transactions. A fee
              market ensures that doing such attacks, for an extended period of time, to become expensive.
            </li>
          </ol>
